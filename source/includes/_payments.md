The Payments endpoint provides access to payment information associated with your application.
Applications receiving claim payments (ERAâ€™s) through PokitDok Platform may review details for claims submitted
through PokitDok Platform as well as payment information received for claims originating outside of
PokitDok Platform.  Applications receiving claim payments may also fetch raw ERA (X12 835) data if
more detail is needed.

### Endpoint Description

Available Payments Endpoints:


Endpoint | HTTP Method | Description
-------- | ----------- | -----------
/payments/ | GET | List payments associated with the application that match the provided search criteria 
/payments/{id} | GET | Return detailed information about the specified payment.  API applications will receive a `payment_id` on their claims activities when they're associated with a payment.  The payment id may also be discovered by a /payments/ search or via a payments callback.
/payments/{id}/data | GET | Return the full data associated with the payment.  By default, it returns a list of claim payment objects as described in the [claim payments reference](claim_payments.html).  The `Accept` header may be used with a value of `application/edi-x12` to access the Raw X12 835 data when the payment type is `claim_payment`

The `GET /payments/<id>/data` response will vary depending upon the type of payment and the `Accept` header value that is included with the request.
By default, payments of type `claim_payment` will return a list of claim payment objects as described in the [claim payments reference](claim_payments.html).
When the `Accept` header is set to `application/edi-x12`, these payments will return the raw X12 835 data associated with the payment.
