following functionality:

* Tracking of long-running asynchronous activity status
* Monitoring of system health, connectivity, and uptime
* Account usage and billing information
* Management of API keys and authentication details for access
* App security settings for API callbacks
* Documentation, examples, and API references
* System messages and notifications, such as for scheduled maintenance downtime
