# Client Libraries
To simplify authorization and access to the PokitDok API, we provide client
libraries for a number of programming languages. These libraries offer full
access to the PokitDok API with a minimum of code, usually just a few lines.
These libraries are hosted on
[PokitDok's Github repo](https://github.com/pokitdok).

The following sections go into further detail on the underlying details of
connecting directly to the PokitDok API. This is of use if you're implementing
the APIs in a programming language for which we currently don't have a client
library.
