PokitDok API Documentation
==========================

*This documentation was created with Slate. Check it out at [tripit.github.io/slate](http://tripit.github.io/slate).*

This repository contains developer docs for the [PokitDok APIs](https://platform.pokitdok.com)

### Found a bug? Want to help update these docs? Excellent!

 1. Fork this repository on Github.
 2. Clone *your forked repository* (not our original one) to your machine with `git clone https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/apidocs-v4.git`
 3. `cd apidocs-v4`
 4. Install all dependencies: `bundle install`
 5. Start the test server: `bundle exec middleman server`

Or use the included Dockerfile! (must install Docker first)

```shell
build_server
start_server
```

You can now see the docs at <http://localhost:4567>. Whoa! That was fast!

*Note: if you're using the Docker setup on OSX, the docs will be
availalable at the output of `boot2docker ip` instead of `localhost:4567`.*
